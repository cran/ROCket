Description: A set of functions for receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve 
    estimation and area under the curve (AUC) calculation.
    All functions are designed to work with aggregated data; 
    nevertheless, they can also handle raw samples. 
    In 'ROCket', we distinguish two types of ROC curve representations:
    1) parametric curves - the true positive rate (TPR) and the false positive rate (FPR) 
    are functions of a parameter (the score),
    2) functions - TPR is a function of FPR.
    There are several ROC curve estimation methods available. An introduction to 
    the mathematical background of the implemented methods (and much more) can be found in
